Stereo Vision Disparity map using Image processing through opencv

The map files are to rectify camera distortion and give you a smooth rectified stereo images.

Connect your stereo camera to the system and run the program. 
command:
python imgsplit.py

filteredImg is the depth map. filteredImg is a 16bit image if you convert it to 8 bit you will get disparity images.

In disparity map, nearer objects have high intensity and intensity decreases as distance increases.
